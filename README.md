🧠 Project Overview

This project is part of the Codebasics Resume Challenge, where I analyzed and presented data-driven solutions for Quick Bite Express, a food delivery brand that experienced a business downturn.

The objective was to uncover root causes, identify recovery opportunities, and develop actionable insights to help the company regain growth momentum.
